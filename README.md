# radiation
Codes for the analysis of C. elegans samples of different DNA repair deficient backgrounds exposed to ionising radiation for the following publication which is currently under submission:

B. Meier, N.V. Volkova, et al. "C. elegans genome-wide analysis reveals DNA repair pathways that act cooperatively to preserve genome integrity upon ionizing radiation"

`Analysis_public.Rmd` contains the codes for data upload and mutation rates and signature investigation.

`Location_codes_for_IR_public.R` is a script for generating mutation location plots per chromosome per genotype and analysing clustering.

`plotting_functions_IR.R` contains the functions necessary for generating mutation signature plots.

`useful_functions.R` contains additional functions used for analysis or data upload.

`data` folder contains instructions for data upload and processing.
